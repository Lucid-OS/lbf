### What's up with checklinks?

At the moment some things are not fully functional within check links, This is due to me coding it to work from within the old lucid-build framework which was not modular and extendable.

In order to fix things I have to break a lot of things too. The bottom line is that this kind of sucks. I am working to fix and make everything more modular however things need to be done in the appropriate order.

### How do I use checklinks?

Check links can be used with the `check-links -vn` command. Where the -n flag takes in the name of a package from the ABS at this time.

Other functionality will not work due to the permissions within the ABS directory but will be used later on.
